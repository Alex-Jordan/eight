<p>With this view of comparing sizes, we may turn to  infinite sets.  For instance, we may compare the set of natural numbers \(\mathbb{N} = \{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}\) with the set of integers  \(\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}\text{.}\).
On one hand, \(\mathbb{Z}\) may appear to be much larger because everything that is in \(\mathbb{N}\) is also in \(\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\), and still \(\mathbb{Z}\) contains other numbers such as 0 and all the negative integers!  On the other hand, you would be wrong for thinking this.  The sets have the same size, because we can pair the elements of \(\mathbb{N}\) precisely with the elements of \(\mathbb{Z}\) so that neither set has any elements left over.  The table below suggests how to do this:</p>
