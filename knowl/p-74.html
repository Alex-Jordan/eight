<p>How are surfaces germane to the story of \(8\text{?}\)?  It turns out each surface can be given exactly one of three types of geometric structures in which measurements are the same at every point in the space.  The three possibilities for geometry are Euclidean, elliptic and hyperbolic.
We won't dive into the details here, though they are dear to this author's heart (and are explored in detail in <a knowl="./knowl/biblio-hitch.html" knowl-id="xref-biblio-hitch" alt="Bibliographic Entry 4 Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology" title="Bibliographic Entry 4 Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology">[4]</a>).  Rather, let us be content with stating this remarkable fact: <!--Style me with CSS--><em>except for the sphere and the donut, all of the orientable surfaces adhere to hyperbolic geometry.</em>  </p>
