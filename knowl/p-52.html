<p>Meanwhile, mathematicians turned their attentions to placing much of the  mathematical achievements of the previous centuries on rigorous footing.  Set theory plays an important role in this foundation, and one of the pioneers of this field was Georg Cantor.  Born in St. Petersburg in 1845, Cantor was a highly original mathematician who studied, among other things, the sizes of sets.  \(8\) found a kindred spirit in Cantor.  Together they looked at infinity and, to everyone's delightful horror, they proved that it comes in different sizes. </p>
