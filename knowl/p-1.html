<p>Over the years, alert students have noticed that \(8\) seems to appear in my classes more often than chance would allow.  It may be also that I have alluded to the greatness of \(8\) from time to time in these classes.  So I continue to be surprised when these students ask, “What's so great about 8?”  Isn't it clear?  Alas, so many times has this question been asked that it has become apparent that the story of \(8\) needs retelling.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-1" id="fn-1"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-1" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">A portion of this story will appear in <a knowl="./knowl/biblio-hitch-8.html" knowl-id="xref-biblio-hitch-8" alt="Bibliographic Entry 5 The Story of \(8\)" title="Bibliographic Entry 5 The Story of \(8\)">[5]</a></span></span></p>
