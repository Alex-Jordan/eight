<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
<p>Shortly after Pythagoras enjoyed his daily swims, \(8\) made a bold and magnificent breakthrough in a great land to the east.  I refer to the Noble Eightfold Path to enlightenment as taught by Gautama Buddha in eastern India.  
The eightfold path is as profound as it is straightforward:
(1) Right view; (2) Right intention; (3) Right speech; (4) Right action; 
(5) Right livelihood; (6) Right effort; (7) Right meditation; (8) Right contemplation.
Behold! We see a remarkable nod to the self-assured, self-sufficient beauty of the number \(8\text{,}\), with the added bonus of being a blueprint for leading a life free of suffering.</p>
