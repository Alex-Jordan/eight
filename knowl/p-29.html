<p>The Pythagoreans also offer the first known effort to suppress a number's greatness.  That a quantity physically constructed could not be represented as a ratio of whole numbers was a devastating result to them, one which may have precipitated the murder of an individual who let slip this fact to the outside world.  But that's a story for another time.  For all these reasons \(\sqrt{2}\) appears on most top 10 lists for the all time great numbers.   But is it greater than \(8\text{?}\)?  Not a chance!  </p>
