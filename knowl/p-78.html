<p>In my courses \(8\) clearly appears more often than chance would allow, though this phenomenon is not confined to the
classroom.  The other day my son, who is \(8\) more or less, was flossing his teeth, and I said, “You know, son, the eighth tooth in each quadrant of an adult's mouth is called a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>wisdom</em> tooth.  \(8\) is very wise.” He looked at me with what can only be described as a mixture of love and awe. “Gee, thanks, Dad,” he replied.  After a thoughtful pause he asked,  “Dad? What is the smallest integer of the form \(a^b\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct primes?”  I tousled his hair paternally as I replied, “Take a wild guess.”<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-2" id="fn-2"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-2" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">As an addendum to this story, it turns out what he had actually asked was, “Dad? I'm 11.  Can I have some privacy?”  We had a good chuckle over that mixup later.</span></span></p>
