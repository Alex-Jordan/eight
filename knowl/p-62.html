<p>There is no rhyme or reason to this sequence.  We just require that each term is an \(8\) or a \(G\text{,}\), and that the sequence does not terminate.  Two such “Great \(8\)” sequences are different as long as they disagree in at least one spot.  Now, let \(\mathbb{S}\) denote the set of all possible Great \(8\) sequences.  Cantor proved that the set \(\mathbb{S}\) is larger than \(\mathbb{N}\) using a technique that is now called Cantor's diagonalization argument.  Here's how it works.</p>
