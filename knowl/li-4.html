<li id="li-4">Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat, fathers of probability theory, had a view of democracy ahead of their time.  On one fictitious occasion they asked 50 citizens of Clemont-Ferrand to name their favorite number on a 6-sided die.  Fifteen of them replied '4', and the remaining 35 were split evenly among the remaining five options.  They had two weighted dice cast to match the vote: on each die, the probability of rolling a 4 was 15/50, the probability of rolling each of the other numbers was 7/50.  The eager reader can check that with these dice, the most likely sum when rolling them both is \(8\text{.}\)  The people have spoken!</li></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-ubiquitous-8.html#li-4">in-context</a></span>
