<p>Other stars in the number world include \(e, i,\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\text{,}\), and 0.  Zero!  Why not \(8\text{?}\)?  Sure, celebrations of the Golden Ratio \(\phi\) are fun.  It's cute to see it pop up in pleasing architecture, art, and seashells, but has anyone pointed out to you that \(\phi\)'s building block integers, 1, 5, and 2, sum to \(8\text{?}\)?   Is this a coincidence?  I don't think so.  And isn't 
\(8\) foundational to the product of \(\pi\) and \(e\text{:}\): \(\lfloor \pi \cdot e\rfloor=8\text{?}\)?  And isn't 0 just \(8\) without its belt?</p>
