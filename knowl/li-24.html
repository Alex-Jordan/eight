<li id="li-24">Brook Taylor loved his polynomials, and his tennis.  As this story goes, Taylor  preferred a springy tennis ball, one that bounced to 60 percent of its previous height on any given bounce.  One other fact about Taylor (which he liked to trot out at social gatherings) was that the palm of his right hand, when his arms rested normally at his sides, was precisely 2 feet above the ground.  In Taylor's own words: “Notice that, though a lampshade be upon my head, if I release my lucky tennis ball from my right hand which lay relaxed by my side, I can be assured that the total vertical distance travelled by said ball before it stops bouncing will be precisely \(8\) feet.”</li></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-ubiquitous-8.html#li-24">in-context</a></span>
