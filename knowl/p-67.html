The 19th century also saw the development of topology, a rich field of study for mathematicians to this day.  Topology may be described as the study of those features of an object that remain unchanged when the object is stretched, shrunk, or otherwise continuously changed.  The topological viewpoint has shed new light on the greatness of \(8\text{,}\), just as it has dealt a blow to the individuality of several numbers.</p>
