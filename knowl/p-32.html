<p>It also came to pass in India that thinkers developed the place value number system that we use today.  While the ancient Greeks unearthed true gems of mathematical beauty,  we must remember that they represented numbers geometrically.  The place value number system of India represented an important development in the way we think about and manipulate numbers.  This system found its way to Europe in medieval times, thanks to Islamic mathematicians.  In 1202 A.D., in what is present day Italy, a young man named Leonardo of Pisa published <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Liber Abaci</em>, a textbook on arithmetic.  Chapter 1 opens with this sentence (see <a knowl="./knowl/biblio-Mom.html" knowl-id="xref-biblio-Mom" alt="Bibliographic Entry 6 Makers of Mathematics" title="Bibliographic Entry 6 Makers of Mathematics">[6]</a>,p.102):

<blockquote>These are the nine figures of the Indians: 9  8  7  6  5  4 3  2  1.  With these nine figures, and with the sign 0 which in Arabic is called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>zephirum</em>, any number can be written, as will below be demonstrated.</blockquote>
