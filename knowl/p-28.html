<p>Did Pythagoras laugh heartily at this remark?  Or did a kernel of fear take root in his stomach?  History does not record his initial reaction. One wonders whether he instantly intuited the toppling of a central tenant of his school of thought at the hands of his own theorem.  It is true that the value of \(c\text{,}\), which today we denote as \(\sqrt{2}\text{,}\), is not expressible as the ratio of counting numbers, and the Pythagoreans proved it by contradiction, thus giving the world one of the first and most famous uses of this proof technique.
