<p>At the dawn of civilization, \(8\) was a little known integer, nestled between 7 and 9.  It led a quiet life, occasionally making itself useful  to hunters as they checked their digits after run-ins with mastodons and rival clans.  
The oldest known joke involving \(8\) begins with a concussed cave man whose rival Thok stands before him, arms raised.  Thok asks him how many fingers he's holding up. The groggy man furrows his great brow and answers 10, whereupon Thok says, “No.  Eight.  These are thumbs!” which he wiggles and then pokes into the poor man's eyes.</p>
