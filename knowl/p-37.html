<p>We turn our attention now to the scientific revolution, a time in which \(8\) distanced itself from countably many of its peers.  While \(8\) entered this enlightened time admired by bunny lovers, chocolate aficionados with a penchant for gathering in groups of five to share  magnanimously, and with the backing of one of the world's great religions, it had not joined the ranks of the truly great numbers.  But that was all about to change, in large part due to its collaboration with two giants of the age: Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. </p>
