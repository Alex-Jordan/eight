<p>One hears whispers of a conspiracy to keep \(8\) in the shadows. Consider the base 10
number system that has been thrust upon us, even though base \(8\) has clear advantages. For
instance, the diabolical number 666 would be written in base \(8\) as a harmless and pleasing 1232,
practically a kid's song waiting to happen. Consider Urbain Le Verrier's discovery of Neptune in
1845 (using mathematics, not a telescope) which gave us an eighth planet in our solar system. This
incited a mad dash to find another planet, presumably because \(8\) just wouldn't do. Of course,
this led to the regrettable classification of Pluto as a planet, an error we corrected just a few
years ago.</p>
