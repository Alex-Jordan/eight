<p>In the 1860s mathematicians managed to completely classify the compact and connected surfaces. There are infinitely many different ones, but we have a complete list of them.  If you ran into a surface in a dark alley, it would be topologically equivalent to one of the surfaces on this well-known list.  In fact, the (infinite) family of orientable surfaces may be described as follows:  Each orientable surface is topolocially equivelent to a sphere with some number of handles attached to it. For instance, the donut is topologically the same as a sphere with one handle (which looks like the hoppity-hop in <a knowl="./knowl/figure-surfaces.html" knowl-id="xref-figure-surfaces" alt="Figure 6.2 " title="Figure 6.2 ">FigureÂ 6.2</a>) because one can be gradually morphed to look like the other.  The four-holed donut is essentially a sphere with four handles.</p>
