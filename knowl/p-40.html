<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
<p>Newton was an astute observer of the natural world, although he occasionally sat beneath over-ripe apples with little regard for his personal safety.  In the spirit of his times, he believed nature could be quantified.  For instance, in his early years he put forth a serious effort to quantify his happiness.  He even developed a unit of measure for happiness: the warmfuzzy.  Newton ran controlled experiments involving bread puddings from which he established a relationship between the rate at which his happiness changed and the number of bread puddings he had consumed.  Although the original notes have not survived to the present day, this very paragraph points to the following result of Newton's observations: 
\begin{equation*}
H^\prime = 6p(2-p),
\end{equation*}
 where \(H^\prime\) represents the rate at which his happiness level is changing (in units of warmfuzzies per bread pudding), and \(p\) is the number of bread puddings consumed on a given day.   </p>
