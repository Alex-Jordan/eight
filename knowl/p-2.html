<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
<p>The goddess of fame has smiled upon some numbers, leaving others to a life of toil and anonymity. Take \(\pi\text{.}\).  So much has been written about Mr. 3.14159265358... .  Much of its allure, no doubt, comes from the fact that \(\pi\) “arises naturally.”  School kids, some of them not yet eight, are taught that if you divde the circumference of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>any</em> circle by its diameter you get \(\pi\text{.}\).  At some point, these same kids are asked to worship the fact that the area enclosed by a circle having radius one foot is \(\pi\) square feet, on the nose.  But are these kids taught that if you take two circles, each having radius \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\) feet, and you place them one just resting on top of the other so that they form an \(8\text{,}\), then the total area enclosed by both circles is \(8\) square feet on the nose?</p>
