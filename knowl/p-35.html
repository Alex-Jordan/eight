\(8\)'s title as the most interesting Fibonacci number was reinforced by the discovery in 1888 of the The Chiquimula Chocolate Bar Scroll, which scholars believe was written in the 13th century.  Translated, it reads:

<blockquote>Let a bar of chocolate be found simultaneously by five strangers, and let the bar consist of 10 squares, in the natural way, arranged in two rows of five.  The strangers agree that each ought to receive 2 squares, and that their 2 squares be of one piece, whole, and unbroken.  In how many ways might they distribute the treasure so as to avoid bloodshed?</blockquote></p>
