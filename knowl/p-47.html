<p>Graph theory was born from the solution to a puzzle that came to Euler's attention in 1736.  In Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) at that time one found a picturesque scene on the Pregel River: seven bridges joining four different land masses, as pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/figure-bridges.html" knowl-id="xref-figure-bridges" alt="Figure 4.1 " title="Figure 4.1 ">Figure 4.1</a>.  The puzzle that Euler answered was this:  Can one walk in Königbserg in such a way as to traverse each bridge exactly once, following these rules:  (1) you can only access the islands by the bridges; and (2) there is no backtracking on bridges (once you begin to walk on a bridge you must cross to the other side).  There was no requirement that you end your walk where you started it.  Such a walk, if it exists, is now called an Eulerian path.</p>
