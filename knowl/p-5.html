<p>But \(8\) has its champions.  I recently spoke with Alan Moby, secretary of Gather
Renown for \(8\) (GR8), a new organization that is
working to promote eight to its rightful place among
the world's most famous numbers. I asked about the
GR8 campaign to get eight added to the equation
\(e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0\text{.}\).  Moby said, “GR8 has worked tirelessly to assemble the key numbers in a way that ensures equality, and we couldn't be more pleased with the result. We now have the world's greatest numbers joined in one superstar equation.  Behold!”
