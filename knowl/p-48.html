<p>Euler not only solved the puzzle (the answer is “no”), but also, being a mathematician, provided a method by which one could very quickly tell whether such a walk was possible for any number of bridges and any number of land masses.  Thus, graph theory was born and Euler provided its first theorem.  But why did Euler choose this particular puzzle with which to launch this new field?  Scratching below the surface in a way eerily similar to the work Robert Langdon regularly did in <!--Style me with CSS--><em>The Da Vinci Code</em>, we find that his choice was motivated by the desire to offer a tribute to the number \(8\text{.}\).</p>
