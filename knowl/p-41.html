<p>According to this model, as Newton begins to munch bread pudding, his happiness level will rise due to the positive values of \(H^{\prime}\text{.}\).  His happiness will be increasing fastest at \(p = 1\) (at which point it is increasing at a whopping rate of 6 warmfuzzies per bread pudding!) but his happiness will continue to rise as long as \(H^\prime\) is positive, which is the case until \(p = 2\text{.}\). If he were to keep on eating bread puddings after having two, his happiness level would begin to fall toward what he called grumpiness, since \(H^{\prime}\) is negative when \(p\) exceeds 2. </p>
