<p>The first half of the 19th century is viewed as the Romantic Age in European music, art, and literature.  Artists turned away from the rationalism of the previous age, and began drawing inspiration from emotional responses to the natural world and the world of ideas, including the concept of infinity.  Edmond Burke once wrote<a knowl="./knowl/biblio-Burke.html" knowl-id="xref-biblio-Burke" alt="Bibliographic Entry 2 A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful" title="Bibliographic Entry 2 A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful">[2]</a>: “Infinity has a tendency to fill the mind with that sort of delightful horror, which is the most genuine effect and truest test of the sublime.”</p>
