<p>This tells us that when you run into that surface in the dark alley, the probability is 1 that it adheres to hyperbolic geometry.  So, if you are a two-dimensional bug named Bormit, and you assume your universe adheres to hyperbolic geometry, and you also believe in an Occam's Razor sort of way that it must be the simplest of all worlds, which world would it be?    Interpreting “simplest” as “fewest number of handles”, Bormit's world would be the sphere with two handles. The author has taken the liberty of providing a spare rendition of this most magnificent of surfaces in <a knowl="./knowl/figure-2holedtorus.html" knowl-id="xref-figure-2holedtorus" alt="Figure 6.3 " title="Figure 6.3 ">Figure 6.3</a>.  Does it look like an homage to any particular number?</p>
