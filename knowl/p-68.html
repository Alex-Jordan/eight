<p>A central question in topology is whether two given objects are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>topologically equivalent.</em>  That is, can one object be continuously changed until it looks like the other?  For instance, 6 is topologically equivalent 9: 6 can be “morphed” to look just like 9 (just stand 6 on its head). It is also true that one, two, three, five and seven have topologically equivalent symbols, an obvious morale crusher to these numbers in desperate need of some sort of personal identity.  In fact, each of these numbers is topologically equivalent to a straight line segment.  Go ahead and check: with a piece of string you can form each of these numbers without changing the nearness relationship among the points of the string (e.g., you don't tie the ends of the string together, or cross it over itself, or cut it into pieces).</p>
